        <p>Phishing is a common type of cyber attack that targets individuals through email, text messages, phone calls, and other forms of communication. A phishing attack aims to trick the recipient into falling for the attackers desired action, such as revealing financial information, system login credentials, or other sensitive information.
         As a popular form of social engineering, phishing involves psychological manipulation and deception whereby threat actors masquerade as reputable entities to mislead users into performing specific actions.These actions often involve clicking links to fake websites, downloading and installing malicious files, and divulging private information, like bank account numbers or credit card information.Since the mid-1990s, the term “phishing” has been used to identify hackers who use fraudulent emails to “fish for” information from unsuspecting users. However, phishing attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and are now broken down into different types, including email phishing, spear phishing, smishing, vishing, and whaling. Each type is characterized by specific channels and methods of execution – email, text, voice, social media, etc. – all with a similar underlying intention.</p>

         <p>Safe browsing habits refer to the various steps and measures taken by internet users to maintain their security and safety while accessing and exploring various online platforms. This practice shields and protects users from issues such as cyber-attacks, identity theft, phishing schemes and scams, as well as accidental exposure to inappropriate content.

            In the present digital age, as online activities have become a fundamental part of our lives, there is an increased need for safe browsing habits. With immeasurable amounts of confidential and personal information being stored and shared online, such tasks as banking activities, sending vital emails or even posting images on social media have increased potential risks toward user data and privacy. These vulnerabilities often leave open opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit any possible loopholes.</p>

            <p>A computer virus is an ill-natured software application or authored code that can attach itself to other programs, self-replicate, and spread itself onto other devices. When executed, a virus modifies other computer programs by inserting its code into them. If the virus replication is successful, the affected device is considered “infected” with a computer virus.

                The malicious activity carried out by the virus code can damage the local file system, steal data, interrupt services, download additional malware, or any other actions the malware author coded into the program. Many viruses pretend to be legitimate programs to trick users into executing them on their devices, delivering the computer virus payload.
                
                Computer viruses are standard programs; instead of offering useful resources, these programs can damage your device. Computer viruses are typically crafted by hackers with various intentions, like stealing sensitive data to causing chaos in systems. Some hackers create these malicious programs for fun or as a challenge, while others have more sinister motives like financial gain or cyber warfare.</p>

                <b>Tips for preventing computer viruses</b>
